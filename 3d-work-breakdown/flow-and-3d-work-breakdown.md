<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (65).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As the work moves through the flow model modes of conceptualise, commence, construct, confirm and complete, the work progressively elaborates through the direction, discovery, and delivery levels of the work breakdown hierarchy.&#x20;

The flow modes are the work states whereas the 3Ds are used to show the progressive elaboration of the work. &#x20;

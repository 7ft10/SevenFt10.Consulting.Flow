# Rollback or Roll-forward

Traditionally a rollback was the preferred method of adjusting a failed change performance.&#x20;

Rollback is defined as performing each step in reverse in order to undo the change and revert the state back to the initial state without any residual impacts or effects of the change.&#x20;

Modern change management looks at rolling forward, where new change sets are created, tested and performed on top of the current state in order to adjust towards success. Additional steps are added to the change rather than undoing them.&#x20;

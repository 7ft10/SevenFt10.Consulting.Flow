Here you review the outcomes of the Experiment. Normally you do this after the amount of time you thought you would need for the change to stick.

This is also the phase in which you embed the change. This may take minutes or hours or may take months. &#x20;

A post-implementation review (PIR) is often the best way to capture the success or otherwise of the change roll-out. A comment by the requestor or implementor may be sufficient for minor changes.

Metrics may also be used here to indicate the success of the roll-out. For instance, a change request for a new router may be accompanied by data to show that the new router's network performance is far higher than the previous one, indicating that the change was a success.

Change request audits will show the overall state of change management by using data collected at each stage.

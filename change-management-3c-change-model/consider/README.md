# Consider

Prioritize, analyse, consider risk, authorise and make decisions for what to change (and what NOT to change).

The consider stage of the process is where all the data about the change is taken into account and authorisation and approvals are given to implement the change. If the change is low risk,then auto-approvals may be used.&#x20;

Audits of all approvals are kept (including auto-approvals) in case there is a need to roll-back a change. Audit data is also used as part of continuous improvement practice to update the policies and procedures.

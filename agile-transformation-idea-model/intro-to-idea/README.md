# Intro to IDEA

## IDEA-Tanzaku

{% hint style="info" %}
Tanzaku 短冊 (たんざく) means strip (of paper) in Japanese. It is a long, narrow card on which Japanese poems are written (vertically).

During the Tanabata or Star Festival, also known as the Star Festival, which celebrates the meeting of the deities Orihime and Hikoboshi, people write wishes in the form of poetry on tanzaku and hang them on bamboo or a "Wish Tree". 

A transformation often starts as a wish from management or from the "do-ers" - sometimes both!

We take a strategic view of each issue, considering the overall value proposition against our strategic goals. We build roadmaps for team and individual skills growth in all dimensions (not just technical) to maximize our ability to deliver on our strategies.&#x20;

You should always start at the beginning of the strip, but some strips may have shorter sections than others.  Each topic flows through the "idea strip". &#x20;

For example, stand-ups: &#x20;

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th>Initial Exposure  </th><th>Develop Basics </th><th>Evolve &#x26; Reflect  </th><th>Accelerate &#x26; Kaizen </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Attend a training session, read an article or book on stand-ups. </p><p><br>Have a coach/trainer explain why this is something that the team should try. </p></td><td>The team tries it out for themselves (e.g. three questions - follow a script). </td><td><p>Try walking the wall.</p><p></p><p>Try having a different IM for each iteration so that anyone can run it </p></td><td><p>"Best stand-ups ever!"  </p><p></p><p>Valuable and run as often as required. </p></td></tr></tbody></table>

&#x20;Ideas are then chained together. &#x20;

Or even considered to be a Mobius strip, where we start to accelerate, we learn that there is more to learn and are exposed to new practices.

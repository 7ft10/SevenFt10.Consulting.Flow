This is determined during Commence mode.&#x20;

## Example

There are four sizes from which you and your team will size each Epic as you unpack the work required before delivery:

* SMALL     Between 1 and 2 sprints
* MEDIUM  Between 2 and 4 Sprints
* LARGE      Between 4 and 6 Sprints
* X-LARGE   Bigger than a quarter

## Epic Estimating <a href="#howtoguide-opportunityandepicestimations-epicestimating" id="howtoguide-opportunityandepicestimations-epicestimating"></a>

* Consider the following to build the Delivery Plan for the initiative
  1. Estimate Epics (Effort, complexity and uncertainty)
  2. Prioritise Epics (MoSCOW)
  3. Sequence Epics
  4. Confirm Team Availability
  5. Prepare Delivery Plan
* Provide T-Shirt estimates at the Epic level to improve the accuracy of estimates
* Provide guidelines to consider **Effort**, **Complexity** and **Uncertainty** when estimating.
* T-Shirt estimates feed into quarterly planning
* Change the **Epic T-Shirt estimates range** to:
  * Small (S): Between 1 and 2 sprints
  * Medium (M): Between 2 and 4 Sprints
  * Large (L): Between 4 and 6 Sprints (Recommended to break it into smaller increments)
  * Extra Large (XL): Bigger than a quarter (Consider breaking it down before planning the quarter)

## **T-Shirt Relative Estimation**

Question Bank and Estimation Technique which can be used as a collaboration tool to discuss **Effort, Complexity and Uncertainty.**  This tool can be used in any way you see fit, and the questions can be customised to suit the project.

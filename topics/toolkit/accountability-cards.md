Accountability cards are a technique that individuals and teams can use to reflect, improve and commit to new habits, which in turn can lead to increased performance.

An individual can utilise the experience of the team to obtain feedback on ways to practice a new behaviour and also hold each other to account to practice that behaviour in order to improve.

## How to <a href="#accountabilitycard-howto" id="accountabilitycard-howto"></a>

1. Allow 1 hour to introduce the technique and identify the first set of behaviours that you wish to work on, along with a time frame to practice the behaviours and then reflect.
2. Follow the pack and explain that in order to improve performance, we must look to identify the interference that holds us back.
3. Give people 5 min to reflect individually on the areas that currently hold them back.
4. Ask for volunteers to share back a few examples for 5 min.
5. Introduce the personal and interpersonal behaviours list that have been associated with high performance.
6. Introduce the three steps to form a new habit. Show how this has been translated into the Accountability card.
7. Ask individuals to spend 10 min choosing one personal and one interpersonal behaviour they may like to improve over a time-boxed period. e.g. Next fortnight. This could be done individually and shared back with the group or in pairs.
8. Share back individual Accountability cards and agree on a date to get back together to review results and set the next increment improvement. Help each other with action plans if people are having trouble defining ways they might practice a new behaviour to enable it to become a habit.

# ICaRuS Scoring

## What is ICaRuS Scoring? <a href="#icarusscoring-whatisicarusscoring" id="icarusscoring-whatisicarusscoring"></a>

ICaRuS scoring is a prioritisation method built on concepts like WSJF and the GIST framework. It takes into account the impact areas that Auto & General are currently focused on and uses a mathematical calculation to arrive at a number that can be used to prioritise against other Opportunities.&#x20;

## Exceptions to the Rule

As in sports and in politics, there are often times when we defer to a "Captain's Call".&#x20;

These are Opportunities that need to be pursued even if they are not scoring highly. These should be kept to a minimum and come with inherent risks.&#x20;

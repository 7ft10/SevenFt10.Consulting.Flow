## Analyse

Analyse all Stories for the sprint and assess what Business functions/areas will be affected by them&#x20;

Populate the risk table with what you have identified&#x20;

## Question

As a team, run through the risks asking the questions, If we did not test this change what would be the likelihood of something going wrong? If something did go wrong what would the damage to the business be?&#x20;

Table is populated with team assessment, and risk rating is applied to each story/change&#x20;

## Sort&#x20;

Sort the stories/changes by risk, with the highest at the top.

Table is sorted by highest rated risks.

## Mitigate&#x20;

As a team work out how the risks will be mitigated, starting with the highest-rated risks first.

Make notes on what will be done to mitigate the risk. For example, Run existing tests, Write new Tests, Peer Review of code.

## Prioritise

The Completed list should now be used as a prioritised list of work for the sprint.

Start writing/executing tests based on the priority

# Test Plan

{% hint style="success" %}
_**We use this to** implement the agreed strategy around checks and tests **so that we can** have a common understanding of which environments will perform the tests._ &#x20;
{% endhint %}



Test Plan improvements are actively and continually being worked through, with the Test Leadership team driving this activity. &#x20;

Ideally, we want to have one overarching Test Plan and represent the different areas we are testing under the coverage sections. Having multiple test plans for the same initiative duplicates effort.

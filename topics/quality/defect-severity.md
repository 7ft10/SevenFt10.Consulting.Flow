# Defect Severity

Defect Severity is defined as the degree of impact a defect[ ](https://www.guru99.com/defect-management-process.html)has on the software application under test. A higher effect of the defect on system functionality will lead to a higher severity level.&#x20;

The Test Analyst will initially determine the Severity level of the defect based on a combination of their own system knowledge and impact on their testing.

However, this determination should be supported by conversations with the Devs, BAs, Business SMEs or Product Owner to understand the potential business impacts correctly.

## Critical&#x20;

A defect that causes critical disruptions to the business operation and no workarounds are available. A defect that causes the application or a critical function to crash or produce incorrect results. A defect that would cause critical data, compliance, or regulatory breaches. Blocks all testing efforts and has no way to proceed.&#x20;

## Major&#x20;

A major defect would result in the loss of some business functionality and would require an unacceptable workaround in Production.  A defect that makes a major functionality/feature behave grossly differently from what is expected or specified in the requirements. A defect that would cause negative Brand impacts. (To be determined by PO, Business Owner)  Blocks testing efforts for an area in scope for this sprint&#x20;

## Moderate&#x20;

A Moderate defect is one that occurs when the product or application doesn't meet certain criteria or produces an undesirable behaviour. However, the functionality as a whole is not impacted.&#x20;

Defects where an acceptable workaround is available.&#x20;

## Minor&#x20;

A Minor severity defect including anything cosmetics such as spelling mistakes, incorrect alignment, and font displays.  This defect is also for any issues that do not affect functionality or data.&#x20;

No workarounds are required.

Defects can be defined as an anomaly or error which causes a deviation between actual results and the expected results.

A Defect can occur due to multiple reasons, such as an error in logic, code, or configuration which will cause unpredicted/unanticipated results.

Defects can also occur when there is a misalignment or misinterpretation of requirements.

## Functional&#x20;

Functional defects are the errors identified in case the behaviour of software is not compliant with the functional requirements. During Functional Testing:

## Performance

Performance defects are those bound to software’s speed, stability, response time, and resource consumption. During Performance Testing: Load, Stress, Endurance, Spike etc. A system’s response time is X times longer than that stated in the requirements.&#x20;

## Compatibility

An application with compatibility errors doesn’t show consistent performance on particular types of hardware, operating systems, browsers, and devices or when integrated with certain software or operating under certain network configurations. During Compatibility testing backward, and forward, An app does not properly render on an Android phone but does on an Apple phone.

Elements on a webpage work with Chrome but not with IE.

The application works against the current OS but not the next version.

## Usability

Usability defects make an application inconvenient to use, can impact a user’s experience with the software. During Usability Testing A content layout that is difficult to scan or navigate and an overly complex signup procedure are the examples of usability defects.&#x20;

## Security&#x20;

Security defects are the weaknesses allowing for a potential security attack. The most frequent security defects in projects we perform security testing for are encryption errors, susceptibility to SQL injections, XSS vulnerabilities, buffer overflows, weak authentication, and logical errors in role-based access.

During Compatibility testing: Penetration, Vulnerability Scanning, API Security etc. A user is allowed to upload a .Exe from an uncontrolled location.

Lack of controls on password creation and renewal.

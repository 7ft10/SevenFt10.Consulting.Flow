# Showcase

_**We use this to** share progress on an initiative, with interested parties, stakeholders, and teams, **so that we can** ensure we have the right level of communication for each of our initiatives._ &#x20;

## Overview <a href="#howtoguide-showcase-overview" id="howtoguide-showcase-overview"></a>

Sprint Showcase (or Sprint Review in Scrum) is when the increment created during the Sprint is inspected.

For a Concept Showcase â†’ Use this to demonstrate the decisions made or findings so far.  This might take place during an existing forum (e.g. Quarterly planning).

For an Initiate Showcase - Use this to demonstrate the findings of the team and enable the sponsor and/or key stakeholders to make a go / no go decision.&#x20;

A Showcase may consist of an update as to what was progressed during the allocated time (e.g. Sprint).  Nothing may have been delivered. However, interested parties are still keen to learn what progress has been made.&#x20;

When Showcasing, the preference is to use live demonstrations instead of recordings or slide shows, so we can manage stakeholder expectations straight away if things go wrong.&#x20;

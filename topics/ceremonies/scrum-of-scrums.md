# Scrum of Scrums

We use this to coordinate smaller, independent teams to acts as a single release team, so that we can not only coordinate delivery, but ensure a fully integrated product at the end of every sprint. Overview Scrum of Scrums (SoS) is..

Where members of each Scrum team come together to perform a higher-level equivalent of the daily scrum. Not held every day but instead a few times a week as needed (Tues & Thurs at A\&G). Each team determines which member to send based on who can best speak to the inter-team dependency issues. For SoS at A\&G we send the Scrum Master and a Team member.

Scrum Master will Prompt by Hub and then each team: Questions: What has my team done since we last met that could affect other teams? What will my team do before we meet again that could affect other teams? What problem is my team having that it could use help from other teams to resolve? Timeboxed to no more than 15 minutes Problem solving is deferred to occur after the scrum of scrums has completed The Scrum Master will close the meeting by summarising Actions and Owners to resolve problems raised.

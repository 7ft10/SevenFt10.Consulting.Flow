# Sprint / Iteration Planning

_**We use this to** set the team up for success with clear goals and expectations **so that we can** all be on the same page about what the iteration is trying to achieve._

## Overview <a href="#howtoguide-sprintplanning-overview" id="howtoguide-sprintplanning-overview"></a>

Sprint Planning is the first action in the sprint and sets it up for success.

The whole Scrum team, plus relevant stakeholders and SMEs, should collaborate in this ceremony.

## Input <a href="#howtoguide-sprintplanning-input" id="howtoguide-sprintplanning-input"></a>

* Availability
  * Number of days in the sprint
  * Team members leave or not sprint-related commitments
* Capability
  * Team velocity
  * The skills required to deliver a Story&#x20;
* Constraints, issues and risks
  * Anything that could block or delay the sprint&#x20;
  * Any dependencies from other teams
* Product Backlog
  * Unfinished work from the previous sprint that is still a priority
    * Can be pushed to the Sprint Backlog and reviewed during the planning
  * Action points from Sprint Retrospective
    * It is recommended only to add action points that will affect the velocity of the board.&#x20;
  * Product Backlog Items, preferably in order of priority
* Quarterly roadmap
  * PO reinforces the bigger picture of how the items in Backlog relate to roadmap items.

## Outputs <a href="#howtoguide-sprintplanning-outputs" id="howtoguide-sprintplanning-outputs"></a>

* Sprint goal
  * Why are we running this sprint
  * PO proposes a Sprint Goal that provides focus, and the team collaborate to finalise it&#x20;
  * The sprint goal drives the decisions during the sprint&#x20;
* Sprint backlog
  * A list of Stories done within the Sprint accomplishing the Sprint goal
  * The Scrum team refines the list to a comfortable level of confidence in delivering it
* Plan for the sprint - At least a plan of attack for the first half of the sprint
  * Break the stories further into daily tasks
  * Take into consideration extra time for cross-skilling
  * A good ballpark is to commit to what can be done in 8 days, assuming a day is used on Sprint Ceremonies and other meetings and another day for routine tasks and contingency.

## Timebox <a href="#howtoguide-sprintplanning-timebox" id="howtoguide-sprintplanning-timebox"></a>

The Scrum Guide recommends 8 hours for a four weeks sprint, meaning up to four hours for a two weeks sprint. Instead of doing a long session and risk losing engagement as time passes, a better approach is to set up specific story elaboration sessions, removing story clarification, refinement and estimation from the sprint planning ceremony.

If all stories are "ready", meaning they are elaborated, refined, discussed, understood and estimated at the beginning of the Sprint Planning, the team can plan in an hour.

# Manifesto & Principles

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) outlines twelve principles, which are shown below. These values reinforce the four core values of Agile.

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
* Working software over comprehensive documentation.
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
* Responding to change over following a plan.

These principles can help shape and educate your teams and interactions to maximize engagement and generate value from collaborations.

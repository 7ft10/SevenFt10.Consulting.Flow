# How Long Does A Transformation Take?

Transformation Road Map - For this we need to measure





For the purpose of coming to a working solution fast we decided to use the following benefits only:

Increased Agile Maturity – this benefit is the better usage of Scrum due to the transition. We propose to measure this by the amount of sprints that deliver working and tested software (complying to the DoD), the extent in which business value is driving the product backlog ordering, and the extent in which teams are self-organizing and continuously improving.

Shortened development cycles – this benefit is the shortening of the concept-to-cash timeline. We propose to measure this by the time it takes from idea to solution and to which extent is this time shortening from the Agile transformation.

Increased business value – this benefit is the amount of business value teams deliver from their sprints. We propose to measure this benefit by measuring the value output from each sprint and the extent in which this is increasing from the Agile transformation. We propose to do this with value points delivered (and the points to be defined by the Product Owner).

Increased delivery reliability – this benefit is the amount of estimated/promised output compared to the actual output. Teams simply become more reliable in their predictions. As such the promises made to customers regarding future deliveries are better kept. We propose to measure this benefit by measuring the percentage of stories (or story points) that teams have forecasted in their sprints that have actually been delivered.

Increased velocity – this benefit is the amount of output a team delivers at the same cost (fixed team). Especially the velocity increase during the Agile transformation seems of interest. At the same time: increasing the value outcome of an Agile team is largely determined by the Product Backlog, and not so much by the teams velocity. We propose to measure the cost per story-point delivered. As such, we can then measure the benefit of the Agile transition by the increasing amount of work that gets done at the same cost. Especially if we also measure the value delivered per story point, we can continuously monitor the return-on-investment.

End-user/customer happiness – this benefit is the amount in which end-users and customers are happy with the results delivered. This is the outcome companies want to achieve; preferably with as few software as possible. Less is more to that extent. We propose to measure this by using the happiness metric on a monthly basis \[5].

Employee happiness – this benefit is the amount of energy employees have in their work. This increases retention and makes growth and recruitment easier. Furthermore, happy employees are better connected to the company and are simply more productive. We propose to measure this by using the happiness metric on a monthly basis (or at the end of each Retrospective) \[5]. As an alternative we could consider using retention number on employee level, however, these tend to have a slower effect (people become unhappy first before they leave).

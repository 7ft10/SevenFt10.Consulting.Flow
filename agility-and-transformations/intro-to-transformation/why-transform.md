# Why Transform?

Not faster but sooner &#x20;

Not cheaper but less expensive &#x20;

Not perfect but good &#x20;

Not everything but enough&#x20;

Not best but better &#x20;

&#x20;

Change is a process not an event. &#x20;

Transformation is setting up a continuous process not a (temporal) project. &#x20;

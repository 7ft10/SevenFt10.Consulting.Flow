# How Is The Transformation Done?

An engagement model describes how a team interacts with an organisation, client or internal group. &#x20;

The goal of the engagement model is to best distribute and align the team and the Improvement Team to create a long-lasting relationship. &#x20;

The engagement model is based on people and outcomes that includes a simplified framework of tasks, roles, and collateral that can be used at  either the project or enterprise level. &#x20;

The model should reflect and work with the organisation’s purpose, goals, and values to help achieve the organisation’s vision.&#x20;

A typical initial engagement period is 18 months.&#x20;

IDEA offers a variety of services, tools sets, and collateral that together provide an holistic approach to fulfilling the transformation to a high performing way of working.&#x20;

IDEA is not a big bang approach, but it is a holistic/company-wide approach. After seeing many transformations it is clear that creating an exemplar team within a traditional environment may work for a little while until the team needs to work with other teams within the eco-system. When a team is "book-ended" by traditional working teams it is hard to be agile and eventually the external forces on the team reduce the effectiveness of the transformation. &#x20;

Therefore IDEA takes the approach that the whole company must take the first step on the agile journey together. This means company-wide training &#x20;

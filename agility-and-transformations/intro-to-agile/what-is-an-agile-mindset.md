# What Is An Agile Mindset?

McKinsey Influence model:&#x20;

* Role modelling - through all the case examples discussed in this article, CEO and executive support were key to driving agile transformations. Support behind the scenes is not enough. Leaders have to be seen living and breathing the values daily. Any inconsistency or contradiction undermines the credibility of the entire effort.&#x20;
* Fostering understanding - telling a compelling story of why that makes sense to everyone is important. For companies like Redbubble and Seek, it was about embedding agile values into their company values from the get go. For, Telstra and AusPost it was about urgency of the case for change and showing what good could look like through acquisitions, JVs or new people brought in. Understanding of why agile works can come from external sources in a less intrusive way, like it did in case of Cadbury.&#x20;
* Developing skills and talent - making sure that the teams are set up for success is key. The solution could be more organic and light touch like in Redbubble, where teams were encouraged to share what already worked. It can be more guided with agile workshops and coaches like in Seek. It can be immersive: Telstra's Muru-D incubator was set up to help those completely new to agile see the way it works for small businesses.&#x20;
* Reinforcing formal mechanisms - helping to institutionalise and encourage desired behaviors through either formal structures or incentives:&#x20;

2.0 AGILE MINDSET ALIGNMENT&#x20;

The purpose of the Agile Mindset training and alignment is to put everyone on the same page of what agile is and is not. Surfacing and starting to alleviate people’s fears about agile and the effect that it will have on their job is another key goal of the session.&#x20;

The 1½ hour training session is an entertaining and informative presentation with a brief game quiz and highly-interactive question and answer period. The slide portion covers the agile mindset based on the 4 values in the Agile Manifesto and the 12 principles. Each value is explained through real stories from my own experience. The importance of storytelling to bring these values to life cannot be overemphasized. The agile principle’s picture game reviews the 12 founding concepts followed by an interactive quiz. Pictures are flashed that the participants then shout back the corresponding principle. Small, spongy “green brain” stress toys imprinted with the 4 agile values are tossed out as prizes that add to the fun and learning.&#x20;

Agile planning and delivery is described as well as a brief overview of Scrum and Kanban to address some of the mechanics of how agile might work in their environment.&#x20;

I was at a non-agile conference and asked 28 Product Development leaders if they thought they knew what agile was. All of them raised their hands. I then asked how many of them thought their definition of agile was the same as their neighbors. None of them raised their hands. For me, this experience just reinforced the importance of this upfront training to get everyone aligned on what agile is.&#x20;

Those who come to the session often believe they know what agile is and in truth, many do. A typical session’s agile knowledge-level demographic fits a bell curve. People at the front of the curve admittedly have little agile knowledge and are anxious to learn. People at the back really are agile experts and often help others during the session. The majority in the middle are the toughest. They “kind of” know what agile is which sometimes interferes with new learning. Often ceremonies, tools, iterations, or process used in “doing” agile are confused with “being” agile.&#x20;

The agile principle’s picture game is a winner every time! The value is high-energy during the session and high-retention afterwards. At session close, the participants are asked to name the values and principles sans pictures. They do astonishingly well due to the principle-picture memory association effect.&#x20;

“We tried agile before and it didn’t work” consistently comes up. Asking a few questions in a respectful manner about what it is they actually did almost always reveals that they were not truly agile. Declaring so is unnecessary as it becomes obvious. Frequent objections heard include: big upfront design thinking, command and control culture, nothing useful can be built in 2 weeks, not applicable for large and/or distributed projects, too much time in meetings, specialized roles, huge legacy backlog with little automated testing, and no product owner or customers available.&#x20;

A Different Management Mindset&#x20;

These three Laws— first, small teams working on small tasks in short iterative work cycles delivering value to customers; second, an obsession with continuously adding more value for customers, and third, coordinating work in an interactive network—are the same three principles that enable Spotify to provide personalized music playlists to over a hundred million users every week, and Barclays to start becoming an Agile bank that can provide easy, quick, convenient, personalized banking at scale.&#x20;

When these three laws—the Law of Small Team, the Law of the Customer, and the Law of Networks—are in effect, people in the organization share a different understanding of how the world works and how to interact with the world in order to get things done.&#x20;

For the traditional manager encountering Agile for the first time, counter-intuitive ideas abound. Managers find they can’t tell people what to do. Firms make more money by not focusing on making money. Dealing with big issues requires building on tiny teams. Control is enhanced by letting go of control. Leaders are less like heroic conquering warriors and more like curators or gardeners.&#x20;

When traditional managers enter an Agile organization where these seeming paradoxes are the norm, it’s like travelers visiting a strange foreign country where everything is different: yes may mean no, where no one pays fixed prices, and where laughter may signify fury. The familiar cues that enable travelers to function in their home country are absent. In their place are new cues that are weird and incomprehensible. The result can be bewilderment, frustration, and an inability to cope. Until the travelers grasp what has happened, learn the new cues of the different country and embody them in their behavior, they will find themselves disoriented and incompetent to deal with the different environment.&#x20;

That’s why Agile can’t be implemented within the assumptions of current management practice. Agile means embracing fundamentally different assumptions. For traditional managers, the process usually isn’t comfortable. It isn’t easy. At the outset, it feels just wrong. It’s like learning a strange foreign language. It is only over time and through actual experience and practice that Agile becomes second nature and automatic. This is not about “doing Agile.” It’s about “being Agile.”&#x20;

Ultimately Agile is about embracing a different mindset. The importance of the Agile mindset was striking in the site visits of the [Learning Consortium](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2016/08/13/what-is-agile/). When people in the organization had the right mindset, it hardly mattered what tools, processes and practices they were using, the Agile mindset made things come out right. Conversely, if they didn’t have an Agile mindset, it didn’t matter if they were implementing every tool and process and practice exactly according to the book, no benefits flowed. Agile is mindset.&#x20;

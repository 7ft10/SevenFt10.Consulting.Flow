The final phase of the coaching model is accountability.&#x20;

What good is a goal if thereâ€™s no one to hold you accountable for accomplishing (or amending) those goals when the inevitability of life begins to get in the way?&#x20;

Coaching exemplifies the strength in numbers philosophy and gives you a skilled partner that will support, challenge and hold you accountable for realizing your best personal and professional self.

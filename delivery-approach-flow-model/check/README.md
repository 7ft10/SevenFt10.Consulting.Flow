## What is Good Agile Governance?&#x20;

Reference: https://www.axelos.com/ What is good agile governance?

Agile governance should be simple and supportive. It should trust individuals and give decision-making authority to teams so they can focus on delivering. People who govern should regularly speak to the team to help support, steer and assure. To monitor progress, use a light touch. This means checking delivery a little, but often. Regular reflection on how teams are doing and finding ways to improve is an important part of good agile governance.

Agile governance is about defining the fastest route that brings the most value. By focusing on the things that matter, we apply an agile focus on governance and how to manage programme and project risks effectively. Agile works best when processes are clearly defined and transparent to everyone. Good governance for programmes and projects, regardless of agile is applied, requires a defined structure, ways of working, processes and systems to operate succinctly. As a result, enabling programmes and projects have the ability to scale up and down to adapt quickly to an organizationâ€™s changing needs and environment.

Agile Governance is for senior management to gain and give assurance that investment generates value for the business and reduces the risk of a bad outcome (ISO/IEC 38500).





## Six Functions of Governance

As mentioned, governance techniques are often mistaken for their functions. So what exactly are the functions of governance? Dr Lynda Bourne identifies six core functions of Governance in her [article](https://pmworldlibrary.net/article/the-six-functions-of-governance/). They are:

1. To determine the objectives of an organisation
2. To determine the ethics of an organisation
3. To create the culture of an organisation
4. To ensure compliance by an organisation
5. To ensure accountability within management
6. To design and implement the governance framework for an organisation

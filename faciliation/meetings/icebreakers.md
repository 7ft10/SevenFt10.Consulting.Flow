# Icebreakers

* When facilitating a meeting or workshop, it's important the recipients participate and offer their insight, regardless or rather likely ideally, if that opinion conflicts with the direction of the group.\
  \

* To aid in the effort of establishing a collaborative environment, you might utilize ice-breakers at the start of the meeting (where appropriate) to help the meeting attendees familiarize  themselves with one another, as they may be meeting for the first time and cautious of sharing their insight.
* Below you can find some common suggestions for ice-breakers, you are, however, empowered to research your own icebreakers to find a topic that resonates with you.

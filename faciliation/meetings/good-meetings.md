**Plan**

**Do you need a meeting?**

* Have I thought through this situation?
* Do I need outside input to make progress?
* Does moving forward require a real-time conversation?
* Does this necessitate a face-to-face or video-conference meeting?

**Do you know what you are wanting to achieve?**

* Is the objective clear?
  * SMART goals

**Timebox**

* Have you allocated the minimum amount of time to achieve the objective?
  * When people are given a specific timeframe, they tend to fill it
  * When constrained with time limitations, people feel the urge and experience creative bursts
  * Cut your meetings in half to achieve twice as much

**Attendance**

* Have you got the right people?
* Do you believe your presence will change the outcome?
* Do you think by not attending you, or the attendees, will be more effective as a result?
  * Don’t show up without a declining and a response as to why!

**Pre-Publish Agendas**

* Have you let attendees know what they need to prepare?
* Have you let attendees enter with the right mindset? How are you going to achieve this?
* How will you let attendees know how they will add value?
  * Can decline if they won’t add value

**Do**

**Staying on track**

* If things are getting off track or getting into too much unnecessary details, have you got a parking lot?
* Have you presented the objective clearly and are able to refer to it during the meeting to keep it on track?

**Monitor and Measure**

* Is it working? Are you getting the desired response?
* What is your audience thinking, feeling and doing?
  * Think - What will attendees learn?
  * Feel - What impression will attendees be left with?
  * Do - What will attendees do as a result?

**Check**

**Find and Fix**

* Have you got visual reminders, notifications and other actions to get staff to engage?

**Results**

* Have you documented (or Captured) the results?
* Have you left attendees with clear actions steps?

**Map Back to Objective**

* Does this map back to your measurable communication objectives and SMART goals?
* Are people taking action? Better still, are they inspired?

**Act**

**Reflect**

* Reflect on what you can do differently?
* What worked?
* What didn’t work?
* What’s missing, the presence of which would make a difference?
* What did you learn?
* What will you do differently?

**Modify**

* Have you captured any lessons learned?

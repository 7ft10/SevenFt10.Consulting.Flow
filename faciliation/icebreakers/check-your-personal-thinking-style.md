# Check Your Personal Thinking Style

Clipped from: https://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html

Personal Thinking Styles     Not only do we have our preferred learning and working styles, we also have our favorite thinking styles. Professor Anthony Gregorc, professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Connecticut, has divided these into four groups:

Concrete Sequential

Concrete Random

Abstract Random

Abstract Sequential

   Concrete Sequential Thinkers tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.    Concrete Random Thinkers are experimenters.    Abstract Random Thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.    Abstract Sequential Thinkers love the world of theory and abstract thought.    We stress that no thinking style is superior; they are simply different. Each style can be effective in its own way. The important thing is that you become more aware of which thinking style works best for you. Once you know your own style you can then analyze the others. This will help you understand other people better. It will make you more flexible. And perhaps we can all pick up tips from each other on how to be more effective.

To check your personal thinking style:

1. Read each set of words and mark the two within each set that best describe you.

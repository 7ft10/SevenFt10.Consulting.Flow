# Check Your Personal Thinking Style

Not only do we have our preferred learning and working styles, but we also have our favourite thinking styles. Professor Anthony Gregorc, professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Connecticut, has divided these into four groups:

## Concrete Sequential&#x20;

Thinkers tend to be based on reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.&#x20;

## Concrete Random

Thinkers are experimenters.&#x20;

## Abstract Random&#x20;

Thinkers organize information through reflection and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.&#x20;

## Abstract Sequential&#x20;

Thinkers love the world of theory and abstract thought.    We stress that no thinking style is superior; they are simply different.&#x20;



Each style can be effective in its own way. The important thing is that you become more aware of which thinking style works best for you. Once you know your own style, you can then analyze the others. This will help you understand other people better. It will make you more flexible. And perhaps we can all pick up tips from each other on how to be more effective.

To check your personal thinking style:

1. Read each set of words and mark the two within each set that best describes you.

Theory Behind the Model

Gregorc's Mind Styles model provides an organized way to consider how the mind works. 

 

Perceptual Quality

§         Concrete: This quality enables you to register information directly through your five senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. When you are using your concrete ability, you are dealing with the obvious, the "here and now." You are not looking for hidden meanings, or making relationships between ideas or concepts. "It is what it is."

 

§         Abstract: This quality allows you to visualize, to conceive ideas, to understand or believe that which you cannot actually see. When you are using your abstract quality, you are using your intuition, your imagination, and you are looking beyond “what is” to the more subtle implications. "It is not always what it seems."

 

Although all people have both concrete and abstract perceptual abilities to some extent, each person is usually comfortable using one more than the other. The person whose natural strength in the concrete, for example, may communicate in a direct, literal, no-nonsense manner. The person whose natural strength is the abstract may use more subtle ways to get a point across.

 

Ordering Ability

§         Sequential: Allows your mind to organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner. When using your sequential ability, you are following a logical train of thought, a traditional approach to dealing with information. You may also prefer to have a plan and to follow it, rather than relying on impulse.

 

§         Random: Lets your mind organize information by chunks, and in no particular order. When you are using your random ability, you may often be able to skip steps in a procedure and still produce the desired result. You may even start in the middle, or at the end, and work backwards. You may also prefer your life to be more impulsive, or spur of the moment, than planned.

 

Both ordering abilities are present in each person, but usually a pattern emerges for using one over the other more comfortably.   There are four combinations of the strongest perceptual and ordering ability in each individual:

1.       Concrete Sequential (CS)

2.       Abstract Random (AR)

3.       Abstract Sequential (AS)

4.       Concrete Random (CR)

No one is a "pure" style. Each of us have a unique combination of natural strengths and abilities

**Integrated Culture: The Framework** &#x20;

**by Boris Groysberg, Jeremiah Lee, Jesse Price, J. Yo-Jud Cheng**

**From Harvard Business Review**

**Magazine (January–February 2018)**

If you want to effect a cultural change, there are four things:

*
  * Articulate the aspiration - the why
  * Select and develop leaders who align with that target culture - that’s you
  * Reinforce the desired change through organizational design - that's in progress (Right People -> Right Culture)
  * Use organizational conversation about culture to underscore the important of change - that’s now

  * **How often do individuals in your organization talk about culture?**
    1. Extremely often
    2. Very often
    3. Somewhat often
    4. Not very often
    5. Not at all often

Culture is spread primarily through social interactions and in group settings. To encourage certain aspects of a culture to be brought to the forefront, consider initiating purposeful conversations around focused cultural themes (these can take a variety of forms, such as one-on-one conversations, forums for informal socialization, learning and reading groups, and social media campaigns).

When evolving a culture, leaders serve as important catalysts for change. To align leadership with the aspirational culture, identify current leaders who will serve as role models, select new leaders who embody the culture evolution, and support leaders with targeted development and training.

Company processes such as training and onboarding programs for new employees can help reinforce core values and norms. To ensure that desired culture changes to the organization last over time, consider targeted design interventions such as updates to organizational structure, incentive systems, talent management practices, and knowledge management systems.

**Current state**

Let participants know that there is no 'bad cultures' descriptions here - each one has pros and cons.

There are sometimes cultural aspects that we need to or want to change.

In groups sort these

*
  * Caring. A warm, collaborative, and welcoming place where people help and support one another. It feels like a big family.
  * Purpose. A compassionate and tolerant place where people try to do good for the long-term future of the world.
  * Learning. An inventive and open-minded place where people spark new ideas and explore alternatives.
  * Enjoyment. A playful, lighthearted environment where people tend to do what makes them happy. It feels like a party or celebration.
  * Results. An outcome-oriented and merit-based place where people are driven to achieve top performance.
  * Authority. A competitive place where people strive to gain personal advantage.
  * Safety. A predictable place where people tend to play it safe and think things through carefully.
  * Order. An orderly place where people tend to play by the rules and have a desire to fit in.

What are the top 3 of the group? Chart them and draw lines between them.

**Future State**

Reveal the definition and pros and cons of each to the groups. Get them to select their **new top 3**.

CARING Warm. Sincere. Relational.

Caring focuses on relationships and mutual trust. Work environments are warm, collaborative, and welcoming places where people help and support one another. Employees are united by loyalty; leaders emphasise sincerity, teamwork, and positive relationships.

Improved teamwork, engagement, communication, trust, and a sense of belonging.

Overemphasis on consensus building may reduce options. stifle and slow decision making.

PURPOSE Purpose-driven. Idealistic. Tolerant

The purpose is exemplified by idealism and altruism. Work environments are tolerant, compassionate places where people try to do good for the world's long-term future. Employees are united by focusing on sustainability and global communities; leaders emphasise shared ideals and contribute to a greater cause.

Improved appreciation for diversity, sustainability and social responsibility.

Overemphasis on a long-term purpose and ideals may get in the way of practical and immediate concerns.

LEARNING Open. Inventive. Exploring.

Learning is characterised by exploration, expansiveness, and creativity. Work environments are inventive and open-minded places where people spark new ideas and explore alternatives. Employees are united by curiosity; leaders emphasise innovation, knowledge, and adventure.

Improved innovation, agility, and organisational learning.

Overemphasis on exploration may lead to a lack of focus and an inability to exploit existing advantages.

ENJOYMENT Playful. Instinctive. Fun-loving.

Enjoyment is expressed through fun and excitement. Work environments are light-hearted places where people tend to do what makes them happy. Employees are united by playfulness and stimulation; leaders emphasise spontaneity and a sense of humour.

Improved employee morale, engagement, and creativity.

Overemphasis on autonomy and engagement may lead to a lack of discipline and create possible compliance or governance issues.

RESULTS Achievement-driven. Goal-Driven.

Results are characterised by achievement and winning. Work environments are outcome-oriented and merit-based places where people aspire to achieve top performance. Employees are united by a drive for capability and success; leaders emphasise goal accomplishment.

Improved execution, external focus, capability building, and goal achievement.

Overemphasis on achieving results may lead to communication and collaboration breakdowns and levels of stress and anxiety.

AUTHORITY Bold, decisive, dominant

Authority is defined by strength, decisiveness, and boldness. Work environments are competitive places where people strive to gain personal advantage. Employees are united by strong control; leaders emphasise confidence and dominance.

Improved speed of decision making and responsiveness to threats or crises.

Overemphasis on strong authority and bold decision making may lead to politics, conflict, and a psychologically unsafe work environment.

SAFETY Realistic. Careful. prepared

Safety is defined by planning, caution, and preparedness. Work environments are predictable places where people are risk-conscious and think things through carefully. Employees are united by a desire to feel protected and anticipate change; leaders emphasise being realistic and planning.

Improved risk management, stability, and business continuity.

Overemphasis on standardisation and formalisation may lead to bureaucracy. Inflexibility, and dehumanisation of the work.

ORDER Rule abiding, respectful. cooperative

Order is focused on respect, structure, and shared norms. Work environments are methodical places where people tend to play by the rules and want to fit in. Employees are united by cooperation; leaders emphasise shared procedures and time-honoured customs.

Improved operational efficiency, reduced conflict, and greater civic-mindedness.

Overemphasis on rules and traditions may reduce individualism, stifle creativity, and limit organisational agility.

If there are two in the same quadrant that is good.

If they are all on the same half (across or down) then that is good.

If neither of these, then there may be more work required.

Change behaviours and mindsets will follow

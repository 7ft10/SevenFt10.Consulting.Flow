When you have "**Just Enough**" information and our stakeholders are satisfied that we have done enough to justify additional time and money to be spent on solving the problem.&#x20;

For example, in Conceptualise, we are going wide to understand the problem size and space. When we have got enough information and are satisfied with the results, then we can start to "Go deep" into the problem and move into Commence.

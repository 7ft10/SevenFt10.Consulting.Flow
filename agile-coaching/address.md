One of the greatest attributes of coaching is that it is a safe space where YOU are the only agenda item! If there is a pressing matter that has you distracted during a given session, there is no point in ignoring the obvious.&#x20;

Your needs (personal or professional) are the primary agenda for each session. Confronting the matters that matter most to you is priority number one. This time is also used to review any homework or reflections from previous sessions.&#x20;

Coaching is your opportunity to confront whatâ€™s real in life and leadership without having to be politically correct, and sensitive to constituent needs or image. Let your hair down and be real for once!

Read the person to whom you wish to offer coaching support.&#x20;

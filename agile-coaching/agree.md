Establishing an agreement with your coach regarding how you will work together is critical to ensuring that you receive the value you seek in your coaching relationship.&#x20;

What is your communication style like? How transparent do you tend to be? How will you communicate when youâ€™re not satisfied with the way things are going? What do you hope to accomplish? How long of a session do you need?&#x20;

The more you contract with your coach in the beginning about your needs, expectations and desires, the more beneficial your relationship will be in the long run.

Recognise where a coaching intervention may be helpful and to think about what we individually bring to each situation.&#x20;

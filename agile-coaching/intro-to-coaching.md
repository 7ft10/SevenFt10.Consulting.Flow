## Assumptions of Successful Coaching

The coachee already has the answers. This means that the coach is there as a guide rather than a problem solver. The coach is a catalyst. While they do not create the change in the coachee, they are an assistant in helping them move forward. The coachee is accountable within the coaching process. The coach creates the foundation, but the coachee must do the work. The coach is passionate about assisting in the change process. They are driven to see the client succeed. The coaching process is built on trust. All coaching conversations are confidential, and the coach/client relationship is highly respected.

# Align

Alignment is one of the most powerful phases of the coaching process. Here the coach and client spend time validating the results of the assessment phase and exploring how they align (or misalign) with the clientâ€™s current goals, values and behaviour.&#x20;

Future possibilities and alternative perspectives about day-to-day realities are explored as the client works toward a renewed sense of fulfilment.&#x20;

Powerful discoveries and change often happen during this phase as it sets the framework for the final phases, which are about action and accountability.

Reframe by clearly defining what it is that the coachee would like to focus on as an issue or do differently in the future.&#x20;

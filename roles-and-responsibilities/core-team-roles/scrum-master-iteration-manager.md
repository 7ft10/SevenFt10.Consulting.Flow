# Scrum Master / Iteration Manager

The scrum master or iteration manager is responsible for **gluing everything together** and ensuring that **agile practices** are being done well. In practical terms, that means they help the product owner define value, the development team deliver the value, and the team gets better. The scrum master is a **servant leader**.

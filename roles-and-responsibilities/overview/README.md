A role is a function that a team member performs on a team. A team member may have more than one role on each team.

Teams are long-lived teams with team members growing their knowledge in the business domain over time. The Business Owner/Product Manager is accountable for the delivery and business outcomes for the team. Teams are designed to be autonomous and accountable through transparency. Success Sliders defined by the Business Owner/Product Manager provide the guide rails for success.

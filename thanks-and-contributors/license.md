This repository is open source. Please feel free to fork and make changes as required. If you create something awesome (or find a defect) please merge back so that we can continue to create a community resource.&#x20;

So much of the content created in this repository is as a result of collaboration and hard work from people that I have worked along with over the years.&#x20;

That is why its not "mine" it's "ours".&#x20;

I've put a few logos here and there but feel free to remove them if you want to use them yourself. My only plea is that you credit where it came from (as I have or will if I have missed it - please let me know!). This goes triple for the "big consulting firms" - I've seen my work recycled back to me via these large firms without credit and it's not cool (so I'm trying my best not to do the same, but I am doing this in my "free time" so give me a chance).

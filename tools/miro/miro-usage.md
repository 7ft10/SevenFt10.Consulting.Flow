**User Collaboration short guide for sessions:**\
As an invited attendee to a meeting, or session where a Miro board is going to be used, how you open and collaborate on these boards has changed slightly. Remembering:

* you can no longer create NEW Miro boards
* you must be an invitee in the session
* you can **only** contribute, and collaborate in session shared by a facilitator

\
You will receive an invitation to a meeting or session as per normal 'google meets. ![](https://confluence.budgetdirect.com.au/download/attachments/412716820/worddaveccc4ad9056036a15ff72f9b1aff3ea9.png?version=1\&modificationDate=1664334904931\&api=v2)

* Click and join the session

\


* The normal camera view will open, nothing has changed.
* If you haven't already, open you chat panel from the bottom of screen toolbar so you will be able to access the Miro bard link

* You will see a link in the chat panel on your right
* Click the link, to accept the invitation, and the Board will open for you.

NOTE: The facilitator must be in the meeting to provide the link, it will not appear until they have shared it. They will paste the link for all attendees to access.\
\
\
The Miro board will look as it always has. You will be able to add commentary, collaborate on topics, share information and add notes, and pictures. The ONLY changes are: ![](https://confluence.budgetdirect.com.au/download/attachments/412716820/worddav60b63998ee68954d819d74cdc4eb68af.png?version=1\&modificationDate=1664334905107\&api=v2)

* on the right hand side of the board, you will notice any preferences, or add-ins that you had previously saved or set-up will no longer be available.
* BUT the good news is, they are all still there, you just won't be able to set them up as your favourites, as its a shared board.
* To locate any action not set in the toolbar, just use the arrows, select the tool or action and drag to the right toolbar. It will remain there for the session.

# Why Models?

Models use familiar objects to represent unfamiliar things. Models can help you visualize, or picture in your mind, something that is difficult to see or understand. Models can help scientists communicate their ideas, understand processes, and make predictions.

But, more than the above, a model gives a reference point for us to observe, asses the outcomes, and develop changes to the model. This is best viewed through the "double-loop learning" strategy.&#x20;

Therefore, the models listed in this book are a starting point, reference, and picture that you can use to visualise the steps to becoming agile. The models are there to be changed for your circumstances. No two businesses are the same; no two agile transformations are the same. Therefore no one model is suitable for the different challenges that each different business will encounter. &#x20;

Please take these models and make them your own. The models are purposely at a high enough design to allow for changes in the operations and day-to-day actions of coaches and agile leaders.&#x20;

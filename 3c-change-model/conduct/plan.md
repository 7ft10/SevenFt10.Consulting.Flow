# Plan

•This is the planning stage of your Experiment. At this point, all you have are your assumptions about the change. In this step you validate your approach with people affected by the change.••

The ‘Due Date’ field may be used here to indicate that the change must be implemented on a certain date.

Check lists are a simple way of planning out a change. For high risks changes an implementation plan may require more thought and input from a variety of stakeholders.

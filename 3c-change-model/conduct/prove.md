# Prove

Here you review the outcomes of the Experiment. Normally you do this after the amount of time you thought you would need for the change to stick.••

A post-implementation review (PIR) is often the best way to capture the success or otherwise of the change roll-out. For minor change a comment by the requestor or implementor may be sufficient.

Metrics may also be used here to indicate the success of the roll-out. For instance, a change request for a new router may be accompanied with data to show that the new routers network performance is far higher than previous

indicating that the change was a success.

Change request audits will show the overall state of

change management by using data collected at each stage.

In this step you start working with people affected by the change. Once a change will reach this step, it is part of the process.••

This stage of the process may last from only a few seconds or minutes to months or even longer depending on the nature of the change and the rollout plan associated with the change. For instance, an upgrade to users browsers may be very quick, but implementing a new way of working may take months or even years. By allowing the change to sit in this state enables correct auditing of the change impact across the business.

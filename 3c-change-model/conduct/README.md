# Conduct

Conduct is broken down into three sub-stages:

* Plan
* Perform
* Prove

## Remember

* Generate from options the smallest applicable change, MVC.
* Align the resources, time and calendar for changes (and be aware of interdependencies).
* Enable the change according to plan and in a controlled, successful manner.
* Determine if the change was successful, if further plans are needed, and identify lessons learned.

## ADKAR&#x20;

ADKAR is a great technique that can be used during this phase of the change.

* Process - which processes are impacted?
* Technology - What are the technology impacts?
* Culture - How will this affect culture?

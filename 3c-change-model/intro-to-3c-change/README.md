# Intro to 3C Change

The 3C-Change Management Model is based on the principles of Lean Changement, ITIL v4.0 and other well-established change management theories.

&#x20;

Properly planning a change by applying risk-based thinking can help to avoid negative consequences such as rework or cancellation, or postponement of service; it can also result in positive consequences such as reduction of nonconforming outputs; or reduced incidents of human error.

Where the organization determines the need for change to the quality management system, the change shall be carried out in a planned and systematic manner.

The organization shall consider the following:

* the purpose of the change and any of its potential consequences
* use the integrity of the quality management system
* the availability of resources
* the allocation or reallocation of responsibilities and authorities.

Change management brings discipline and quality control to modifications to the production systems and processes of the organisation. Attention to governance and formal policies and procedures will ensure its success. Adopting formalised governance and policies for operational change management delivers a more disciplined and efficient infrastructure. This formalisation requires communication; the documentation of important process workflows and personnel roles; and the alignment of automation tools, where appropriate. Where change management is nonexistent, it is incumbent on senior management to provide the leadership and vision to jump-start the process. By defining processes and policies, organisations can demonstrate increased agility in responding predictably and reliably to new business demands.

Management shall evaluate the merits of the proposed change and determine the actions necessary to address and implement the intended changes. Wherever it is deemed essential, other departments will be consulted about proposed changes. This may include discussions with engineers, contractors, consultants, or other relevant parties before according to approval for the proposed change.

Before authorizing the implementation of changes, the following points shall be verified:

§   All necessary technical, safety, security and environmental reviews are completed;

§   Risks and consequences identified during the review processes are addressed to the utmost satisfaction;

§   Proposed changes comply with regulatory and legal requirements;

§   Necessary approvals are obtained from the regulatory and/or legal authority wherever required;

§   All affected personnel are informed of the changes and adequately trained where necessary;

§   Documentation about changes and reviews is complete.

The change shall be reviewed by appropriate management, including the direct Manager responsible for the process. Changes must be approved before implementation; however, the level of approval will be based on a risk assessment and may allow for automatic approvals.

Upon implementation of change, the Change Manager shall verify the following.

§   Implemented changes are as intended;

§   Documentations are complete about changes;

§   Changes are communicated;

§   Applicable regulatory and legal requirements are fulfilled;

§   Plans and budgets are amended.

## Model States <a href="#_toc35339163" id="_toc35339163"></a>

The model contains two intertwined cycles – the main cycle and the cycle used during implementation. The main cycle has three states: Capture, Consider, and Conduct. During the Conduct state, there is a smaller cycle that consists of three states: Plan, Perform, and Prove.

### **Capture Change**

Any employee that becomes aware of a need for change can initiate the change management process. The person initiating the process will notify their immediate supervisor/manager, detailing the proposed change on the change management request form. Following approval from the authorised supervisor/manager, the change management form shall then be forwarded to the Change Manager for review.

### **Consider Change**

The Change Manager will log and review the change management request form before forwarding it to the appropriate process owner/manager for potential operational impact, cost/benefit, analysis, and associated risk and to management as appropriate to the change under consideration. If the request is accepted, the appropriate process owner/manager will detail any actions deemed necessary to control the impact of the change and forward the request to the appropriate manager for approval. &#x20;

### **Conduct Change**

The process owner (manager) will be responsible for implementing and coordinating the actions required for the proposed change. If it is determined that further assessment is required during the course of implementing the change, these assessments will be documented and submitted for review prior to completing the change process. Only after all assessments have been reviewed shall the change management process be continued and monitored through completion.

#### **Close Change**

The direct manager shall be responsible for verifying the satisfactory implementation of the proposed change and the effectiveness of any corresponding control measures.

## Implementation&#x20;

The process can be easily mapped to a service desk application.&#x20;

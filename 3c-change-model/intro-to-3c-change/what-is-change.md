# What is Change?

ITIL v4.0 defines a change as the addition, modification, or removal of anything that could have a direct or indirect effect on services. For us, a “change” is the addition, modification or removal of:

* Processes
* Technological/ system changes
* Equipment, hardware, software
* Staff changes
* Legal  and legislative
* Personnel training
* Supplier selection and management

Other types of changes not listed above can be related to any element of the process, such as inputs, resources, persons, activities, controls, measurements, outputs, etc.

Changes that are exempt from this procedure include any changes that are considered part of the day-to-day operation and administration of the system but do not fundamentally alter the way the system works.

# Back-end for Front-end (BFF)

{% embed url="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-software-architecture-patterns/" %}

One problem that comes up when implementing microservices is that the communication with front-end apps gets more complex. Now we have many servers responsible for different things, which means front-end apps would need to keep track of that info to know who to make requests to.

Normally this problem gets solved by implementing an intermediary layer between the front-end apps and the microservices. This layer will receive all the front-end requests, redirect them to the corresponding microservice, receive the microservice response, and then redirect the response to the corresponding front-end app.

The benefit of the BFF pattern is that we get the benefits of the microservices architecture, without over complicating the communication with front-end apps.

# Types

Before embarking on the planning effort, it is important to understand that not all PMOs are created equal. There are multiple types of PMOs, and they can be viewed along multiple dimensions.&#x20;

1. Degree of control or to what extent the PMO can control the outcome of projects and programs&#x20;
2. Degree of scope or to what extent the PMO will impact the strategic goals of the organization&#x20;

### PMOs by Degree of Control

#### Supportive PMO (O1)

Provides templates, best practices, and training to PMs. Low degree of control over projects. The PMO does not necessarily assign project managers and are more likely to report to functional areas outside the PMO. Functional managers tend to have control over the budget and manage project activities. Project managers are viewed as more project coordinators.

#### Controlling PMO (O2)&#x20;

Provides supportive functions AND requires compliance to standards, methods, and tools for project management. Both project and functional managers manage project activities and budgets together. PMO has the authority to take corrective action if there are problems in the application of the standards, methods, and tools.&#x20;

#### Directive PMO (O3)

Provides supportive and controlling functions AND directly manages projects. The highest degree of control over projects. Project managers report to the PMO and have sole control over the project activities and budget.

### PMOs by Degree of Scope

#### Program PMO (S1)

Responsible for planning and execution of projects for a major program. Generally, the program is of high complexity with multiple dependencies. These PMOs tend to dissolve or are absorbed into a larger PMO (i.e. Departmental or Enterprise) after the primary goals of the program have been achieved.&#x20;

#### Departmental PMO (S2)

Responsible for planning and execution of projects and programs within a specific business unit or division within the organization. These PMOs are ongoing in nature.&#x20;

#### Enterprise PMO (S3)

Responsible for planning and execution of all significant projects and programs for the entire organization. This may include both IT and Business projects. These PMOs are ongoing in nature and have the highest degree of scope and impact on the organization.

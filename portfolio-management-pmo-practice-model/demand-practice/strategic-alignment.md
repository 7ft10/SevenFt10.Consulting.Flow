# Strategic Alignment

There are four quadrants to this model:

1. Excel and innovate — You need to perform differentiating activities really well; these are the things that form your competitive advantage and gain you market share. Focus on doing these better than anyone else, as they are your claim to fame. These activities link directly to strategy. Do not under-invest in these activities. Ensure that creativity and innovation focus on these activities.
2. Parity — Parity activities are exactly what the name says. Do them as well as the rest of the market, no better and no worse, as doing them better than the competition gives no advantage. However, they are mission-critical — they must be done well and invested in appropriately. These activities can and should be streamlined and simplified wherever possible as complexity is probably a result of over-investment, which takes opportunities and funding away from more important activities.
3. Partner — Some activities are not important to your core service delivery (or commercial success) but can still differentiate you in the marketplace. For those types of activities, find somebody for whom they are a core competency, and partner with them.
4. Maintenance — Business activities are considered maintenance if they are “neither mission critical nor market differentiating”. These activities are generally intended to keep the lights on and teams should attempt to minimise the effort spent of them. These are also generally good candidates to be considered for automation, outsourcing, or simply droppin

An outcome is a meaningful and fundamental change in the status quo as a result of some work.\* Intended and actual outcomes should be expressed in measurable terms. There are four types of outcomes:

1. Good and intended,
2. Good and unintended,
3. Bad and unintended, and
4. Bad and intended.&#x20;

Value is the often-intangible change that is the result of work and contributes to achieving an outcome.

A portfolio is the prioritised backlog of work underway or to be done. It includes building new products or services, maintaining existing products or services, and business-as-usual (BAU) activities.&#x20;

An activity is any discrete piece of work that is undertaken as part of a change.

# Leadership-Strip (Tanzaku)

The leadership-Strip can be seen as an enantiomer strip. The "leadership strip" fits alongside the "idea strip", complimenting and enhancing the leader's journey through the transformation. &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Enantiomer comes from the Greek ἐνάντιος (enántios), meaning 'opposite', and μέρος (méros), meaning 'part' and used in chemistry to describe non-superposable stereoisomers that are mirror images of each other
{% endhint %}

Leadership is important to any transformation, and becoming a leader has some additional stream sections that can help with the transformation: &#x20;

* Do it&#x20;
  * You cannot lead a team if you cannot do the work yourself&#x20;
  * Knows how it is done &#x20;
* Manage it&#x20;
  * You need to know what is needed to be done and manage the team to get it done&#x20;
  * Drives &#x20;
* Lead it&#x20;
  * You need to know the difference between managing and leading. When you start to lead, you will start to amplify the results &#x20;
  * Shows how it is done, and coaches &#x20;
* Transform it &#x20;
  * When you start to get really great, consistent, sustainable results is when you can start to really innovate and create new leaders within your team&#x20;
  * Develops people &#x20;
